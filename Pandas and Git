## Pandas 🐼

### 1. What is Pandas?

Pandas is a Python library used for working with data sets, you should know this by now. It has functions for analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating data. The name "Pandas" has a reference to both "Panel Data", and "Python Data Analysis" and was created by Wes McKinney in 2008.

Speaking of *analyzing, cleaning, exploring, and manipulating* data, what functions can you use for each of these tasks? 🤔:
- **A**nalyze data?
- **C**lean data?
- **E**xplore data?
- **M**anipulate data?

**Fill the table below:**
  

function | what it does | category
------------ | ----------- | ---------
`astype()` |used to convert the data type of a pandas Series or DataFrame column to a specified data type |Manipulate Data
`groupby()` |split data into groups based on unique values |Analysis Data
`sort_values()` | sorts the rows of a DataFrame based on specified columns |Manipulate Data  
`pivot_table()` |create a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame|Analyze Data
`merge()` |used to combine two or more DataFrames based on common columns|Manipulate Data  
`plot()` |   |  
`corr()` |   |  
`cov()` |   |  
`apply()` |   |  
`loc()` |   |  
`iloc()` |   |  
`iterrows()` |   |  
`aggregate()` |   |

### 2. Pandas and NumPy 🔢 [BONUS 🎁](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1068680/)

Pandas is built on top of the NumPy package, which means that many of the methods in NumPy are also available in Pandas. Data in pandas is often used to feed statistical analysis in SciPy, plotting functions from Matplotlib, and machine learning algorithms in Scikit-learn.

Speaking of NumPy, here are questions about it:

- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.vstack((a, b))

print(c[1][2])
```


- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.intersect1d(a, b)

print(c)
```

  
- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
a = np.array([1, 2, 3])
b = np.array([4, 5, 6])
c = np.setdiff1d(a, b)

print(c)
```

- Which of the following is a function in NumPy used for carrying out Einstein summations?

    - [ ]  `np.tensordot()`
    - [ ]  `np.dot()`
    - [ ]  `np.einsum()`
    - [ ]  `np.outer()`

- The `np.outer` function is primarily intended for:

    - [ ]  Computing the tensor dot product of two arrays.
    - [ ]  Computing the outer product of two arrays.
    - [ ]  Computing the inner product of two arrays.
    - [ ]  Computing the cross product of two arrays.


### 3. Pandas and Matplotlib 📈
Pandas can be used to visualize data using a wrapper for `matplotlib.pyplot.plot()`. You can plot data directly from your DataFrame using certain functions.

- What functions can you use to plot data directly from your DataFrame? 🤔

- What is the output of the following code? And why is it so?

``` python
df = pd.DataFrame(np.random.randn(10, 4), columns=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
df.plot.scatter(x='a', y='b')
```
- What do you know about `np.random.randn()`? And how does it depend on `np.random.seed()`?
